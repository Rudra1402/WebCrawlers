Disease Name,Symptoms,Diagnosis,Treatments
"Giant Cell Tumors","A noticeable bump or lump.
Pain that worsens with movement.
Swelling.
Fractures, as the GCT weakens the bone around it.","Imaging tests, such as an X-ray, CT scan or MRI, look at your bone or cartilage.
Bone scans use a safe radioactive dye and imaging scans to look for a bone GCT.
Biopsy, takes a small tissue sample to examine in a lab for signs of a GCT.","To treat bone GCTs, your healthcare provider scrapes the tumor away from your bone (curettage). Then, they fill the bone in with another piece of bone or a bone cement mixture (bone graft). When tumors are very big, your doctor may prescribe medications, followed by resection (removal) of the bone segment and reconstruction with a prosthesis.
To treat TGCTs, your healthcare provider removes the tissue lining in your joint where the TGCT is."
"Group A Streptococcal Infections","Difficulty swallowing or pain when swallowing.
Headache.
Small red spots on the roof of your moth (petechiae).
Sore throat.
Stomach pain.
Swollen tonsils or lymph nodes.","A blood test to look for an infection.
A rapid test or culture test that swabs your throat and looks for bacteria under a microscope.
A tissue sample to look for an infection in a biopsy.
An imaging test like an MRI, CT scan or ultrasound to look at the damage underneath your skin caused by the infection.","Shortening the length of your illness.
Minimizing symptoms.
Preventing the bacteria from spreading.
Preventing complications and serious illness."
"Hemophilia A","The F8 gene sits on the X chromosome.
Women and people AFAB inherit two X chromosomes, one each from their mother and father.
Men and people AMAB inherit an X chromosome from their mother and a Y chromosome from their father.
If a woman or someone AFAB has an abnormal F8 gene on one of their X chromosomes, they carry hemophilia, but they won’t have symptoms. That’s because there’s a normal F8 gene on their second X chromosome.
They can pass the chromosome carrying the abnormal F8 gene on to their sons. Because men and people AMAB have just one X chromosome, their sons will develop hemophilia. Men and people AMAB can’t pass hemophilia on to their sons, though.
If a woman or someone AFAB has a daughter, they may also pass this chromosome on to that child. Because women and people AFAB have two X chromosomes, their baby is likely to inherit a healthy X chromosome from their father.
Women and people AFAB who inherit a healthy chromosome and a chromosome carrying the mutated F8 gene can pass the gene on to their children. These people are sometimes referred to as carriers.","Complete blood count: Healthcare providers use this test to measure and study blood cells.
Prothrombin time (PT) test: Healthcare providers use this test to see how quickly your blood clots.
Activated partial thromboplastin time test:This is another blood test to time blood clot formation.
Fibrinogen test:This is a blood test to measure the amount of blood protein fibrinogen, which helps with clotting.
Clotting factor test:This blood test shows the hemophilia type and severity.","Healthcare providers typically treat hemophilia A with factor replacement therapy. If you’re receiving this treatment, your healthcare providers will inject concentrated factor VIII into your bloodstream. Factor VIII replaces the missing blood protein, or factor, that helps blood to clot, so you’re less likely to have excessive bleeding and/or be able to control bleeding when it happens. Usually, people with mild or moderate hemophilia A don’t need replacement therapy unless they’re going to have surgery or if they’re dealing with a bleeding episode. Healthcare providers often treat people who have severe hemophilia A with regular factor replacement therapy. Another treatment option is a drug called emicizumab, which is a monoclonal antibody that substitutes the normal function of factor VIII."
"Vitamin A Deficiency","Chronic diarrhea.
Celiac disease.
Cystic fibrosis.
Certain pancreatic disorders.
Bile duct blockage.
Zinc or iron deficiency.
Small bowel bypass or bariatric surgery.
Alcohol use disorder.

After several days, they’ll have you take lower doses of vitamin A until your vision and skin issues start to resolve. Vitamin A supplements can cure night blindness and help lubricate your eyes again. However, vision loss due to scarring from corneal ulcers can’t be cured."
"Hepatitis A","Stomach pain, especially in the upper right quadrant.
Loss of appetite.
Nausea and vomiting.
Diarrhea.
Weakness and fatigue.
Fever.
Jaundice (yellowing of your skin and eyes).
Joint pain.
Itchy skin.

Stay in bed, at least until your fever and jaundice have subsided. After that, you may return to work or school if it’s been at least one week since your symptoms started.
Avoid substances that stress your liver. Take a break from alcohol, smoking, drugs and medications if possible. Check with your healthcare provider before taking herbs.
Keep in touch. They’ll want to check on you periodically to make sure your condition is improving. If you have severe symptoms, they might want to monitor you more closely."

Positron emissions tomography (PET) scan. Providers inject a radioactive tracer into your body to detect early signs of cancer.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This is a painless test that uses a large magnet, radio waves and a computer to produce very clear images of organs and structures within your body.
Lumbar puncture (spinal tap). To do this test, your healthcare provider inserts a needle into your lower back to get a sample of cerebrospinal fluid, the clear liquid that surrounds your spine and brain.
Bone marrow biopsy. To do this test, providers insert a special needle through your skin and into your pelvic bone or breastbone so they can remove a small sample of bone marrow from inside it.","Chemotherapy. Healthcare providers use several types of drugs to kill cancer cells.
Radiation therapy. Healthcare providers use strong beams of energy (radiation) to kill cancer cells or stop them from growing.
Targeted therapy. This treatment involves medications that target specific changes in cancer cells.
Immunotherapy. This cancer treatment uses your immune system to fight cancer by helping your body produce cancer-fighting cells or help healthy cells identify and attack cancer cells.
Stem cell transplantation. A stem cell transplant replaces unhealthy stem cells with healthy stem cells."
"Hepatitis B","Fever.
Loss of appetite.
Nausea and vomiting.
Abdominal pain.
Weakness and fatigue.
Joint pain.","If you have an acute or chronic infection.
If you’ve been infected in the past.
If you’ve developed immunity to the virus.
If the infection is interfering with your liver function.","Vaccination. Healthcare providers recommend an immediate dose of the hepatitis B vaccine if you haven’t had it yet, preferably within 24 hours of exposure. You’ll need two more doses over the next six months to become fully vaccinated against the virus.
Hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG). HBIG is a substance made from human blood containing naturally-produced antibodies to the hepatitis B virus. It’s given as a shot to help prevent infection in people who’ve recently been exposed to the virus."
"Hemophilia B","Everyone receives two X chromosomes from their biological mother and one X chromosome and one Y chromosome from their biological father.
If a woman or person DFAB has an abnormal F9 gene on one of their X chromosomes, they carry hemophilia B, but they won’t have symptoms. That’s because there’s a normal F9 gene on their second X chromosome.
This person can pass the chromosome carrying the abnormal F9 gene on to their biological male child. As men and people DMAB have just the one chromosome, they’ll develop hemophilia B.","Complete blood count (CBT): Providers use this test to measure and study blood cells.
Prothrombin time (PT) test: Providers use this test to see how quickly your blood clots.
Activated partial thromboplastin time test: This is another blood test to see how long it takes your blood to form a clot.
Fibrinogen test: This is a blood test to measure the amount of blood protein fibrinogen, which helps with clotting.
Clotting factor test: This blood test shows the hemophilia type and severity.","Healthcare providers typically treat hemophilia B with factor replacement therapy. In factor replacement therapy, providers inject concentrated factor 9 into people’s bloodstreams. The concentrated factor 9 takes the place of the missing factor and helps prevent excessive bleeding or control bleeding when it happens."
"Cutaneous B-Cell Lymphoma","Fever.
Night sweats.
Swollen lymph nodes in your neck, armpits or groin.
Weight loss.","Blood tests.

"Group B Strep Pregnancy","Fever, chills and fatigue.
Difficulty breathing.
Chest pains.
Muscle stiffness.","Yes, your healthcare provider will test you for GBS late in your pregnancy, around weeks 36 to 37.","Healthcare providers prevent GBS infection in your baby by treating you with intravenous (IV) antibiotics during labor and delivery. The most common antibiotic to treat group B strep is penicillin or ampicillin. Giving you an antibiotic at this time helps prevent the spread of GBS from you to your newborn. It's not effective to treat GBS earlier than at delivery. The antibiotics work best when given at least four hours before delivery. About 90% of infections are prevented with this type of treatment."
"C. diff (Clostridioides difficile) Infection","Persistent abdominal pain.
Swollen, distended abdomen.
Nausea and vomiting.
Loss of appetite.
Fever.
Rapid heart rate.","If your healthcare provider suspects C. diff infection based on your symptoms, they’ll take a sample of your poop and send it to a lab. The lab will test it for evidence of the toxins C. diff produces.","Metronidazole.

Fidaxomicin."
"Hemophilia C","Nosebleeds.
Bruising easily.
Blood in pee.
Excessive bleeding after circumcision.
Painful, swollen bruises after surgery.
Unusually heavy or long-lasting periods.","Healthcare providers diagnose hemophilia C by doing a physical examination, evaluating symptoms like bloody noses or bleeding after dental treatment, and asking about any biological family history of hemophilia or blood disorders.","People with hemophilia C may not need treatment unless they’re going to have surgery or other procedures. When they do, healthcare providers use a combination of fresh frozen plasma from donated blood and medication that keeps replacement clotting factors from breaking down. They may prescribe birth control pills for women who have unusually heavy or long-lasting periods."
"Protein C Deficiency","Blood clots in your veins (also called venous thromboembolism). Blood clots usually form in your legs (deep vein thrombosis) but can also form in the veins of the large and small intestines, your brain, the main vein to your liver and in other areas. You may not have symptoms until adulthood or may not have symptoms at all. Blood clots are more likely to develop with increasing age.","Personal history of having blood clots.
Family history of having blood clots.
Blood tests that determine the level of protein C activity and the level of protein C itself.
Genetic testing to detect mutation in PROC gene (but not needed to confirm diagnosis).","No treatment: Most people don’t need treatment except during surgery or if they are pregnant, have experienced trauma (such as a car accident) or are physically inactive.
Treatment with an anticoagulant: If you have had a blood-clotting (thrombotic) event."
"Hepatitis C","Exposure to needles or sharp objects at work, especially in healthcare.
Tattoos or body piercings performed with unsterilized equipment.
Sharing a razor or toothbrush with somebody who might have bled using it.
Less commonly, through sexual contact that leads to blood exposure.","Liver function tests. Liver function tests are a series of blood tests that evaluate the health of your liver.
Elastography. An elastography is a noninvasive imaging test that measures the stiffness or fibrosis of your liver tissue. It uses ultrasound or MRI.
Liver biopsy. As a last resort, when other tests aren’t conclusive, your healthcare provider may take a sample of tissue from your liver to test in the lab. They can usually do this through a hollow needle inserted through your abdominal wall in a simple bedside procedure.","Sofosbuvir (Sovaldi®).

"Dysphoric Milk Ejection Reflex (D-MER)","Sadness or hopelessness.
Self-hate or low self-esteem.
Sinking feeling in their stomach or feelings of dread.
Anger, sadness or agitation.
Anxiety or irritability.","There isn’t a ton of research about D-MER, so there isn’t an official way to diagnose it. Your healthcare provider will talk to you about your symptoms, when you feel them and how intense they are. Remember, D-MER only occurs during feedings or pumping sessions and goes away shortly after. Describing your symptoms and when they happen can help your provider understand what’s happening.","Increase skin-to-skin contact: If you’re breastfeeding, try bringing your baby closer to your body. This feeling can lower your cortisol levels and decrease your heart rate, almost like a calming effect.
Practice meditation or deep breathing: Trying to relax is key. This lowers anxiety and reduces stress. Take deep breaths in through your nose and out through your mouth.
Find other ways to relax: Getting a massage, listening to music or soaking in a warm tub just before feedings can help relax you and calm you down.
Distract yourself: Eat, watch TV or do other activities during the milk let down as a distraction.
Find support: Seek support for D-MER. Whether it’s your partner, a friend or an online support group, find people who’ll listen to you, talk to you and care for you."

Cardiac catheterization, a more invasive test your provider can use if other tests don’t offer an answer.","Prostaglandin: This medication can keep the ductus arteriosus open, allowing oxygen-rich blood to flow through the body.
Catheterization: A balloon atrial septostomy uses a catheter (thin tube) to widen the natural opening between the atria (right and left upper chambers in the heart). This minimally invasive procedure allows blood to mix so it can collect oxygen and deliver it to the body."
"E. coli Infection","Stomach pains and cramps.
Diarrhea that may range from watery to bloody.
Fatigue.
Loss of appetite or nausea.
Vomiting.
Low fever < 101 °F/ 38.5 °C (not all people have this symptom).","First, wash your hands with soap and water.
If it’s possible to urinate (pee) before setting up for the stool collection, do so. You don’t want to get urine in your stool sample if you can help it.
To collect diarrhea, tape a plastic bag to the toilet seat. You only need to collect a small amount – a couple tablespoons.
Place the plastic bag into a clean (washed and dried) plastic container and seal with lid.
Wash your hands with soap and water.
Write your name and date on the container, place within another bag, wash your hands again and deliver to your healthcare provider on the same day you collect your sample. If you can’t deliver your sample immediately, you can store it in your refrigerator for up to 24 hours.

Blood test. Your healthcare provider will use a small needle to draw a blood sample from a vein in your arm.
Genetic testing. Your provider may send part of your blood sample to a lab for genetic testing. Genetic testing determines whether you have higher odds of developing HUS according to your genes (genetic tendency). This helps determine how long you may need therapies such as eculizumab or ravulizumab. If you have a genetic abnormality, you have a higher chance of requiring long-term therapy with eculizumab or ravulizumab.
Stool test. Your healthcare provider will give you a special container and a disposable spoon. The next time you have to poop, you’ll place plastic wrap or newspaper across the rim of your toilet to collect your poop. You can also poop into a different container. You’ll then use the disposable spoon to collect a small sample, put it in the special container and return it to your healthcare provider.
Kidney biopsy. Your healthcare will provide a small piece of your kidney tissue to examine at a lab under a microscope. Your healthcare provider will first numb the area with a local anesthetic so you won’t feel any pain. They’ll also give you a light sedative to help you relax. Then, they’ll insert a needle through your skin and into your kidney to collect the tissue sample. Kidney biopsies are rarely necessary for adults. Children don’t need kidney biopsies.","Hemolytic uremic syndrome treatment may include blood transfusions, especially red blood cells and platelets. Red blood cells help with signs and symptoms of anemia, including chills, fatigue, shortness of breath and rapid heart rate.

"Tularemia","Fever.
Very large, swollen and painful lymph nodes.
Open wound (ulcer or lesion) on your skin (ulceroglandular tularemia only).","Blood tests. A sample of blood taken from your arm will be sent to a lab. The lab will look for signs of tularemia and might see if F. tularensis grows from it. At first, your blood test may look normal because F. tularensis can be slow-growing. You may have to repeat blood tests a few weeks later.
Biopsy. If you have large lymph nodes or ulcers, your provider may take a sample of your tissue for biopsy. A lab will test the sample for F. tularensis or see if it grows from the sample.
Nasal or throat swab. Your provider may use a long stick with a soft tip (swab) to get a sample of mucus from your nose or throat. A lab will test the sample for F. tularensis or see if it grows from the sample.
Pleural fluid test (thoracentesis). If you have fluid around your lungs, a provider may take a sample of it during a thoracentesis. A lab will test the sample for F. tularensis or see if it grows from the sample.","Treatment of tularemia involves broad-spectrum antibiotics, either given to you by a healthcare provider with a needle (injection) or taken by mouth (pill).

Remove wet clothing and replace with dry clothing.
Cover them up with a jacket, hat and blanket.
Apply external heat to their skin, such as with a heat lamp or hot pack."
"Adult-Onset Still's Disease","Sore throat.
Swollen lymph glands in the neck.
Fatigue.
Headache.
Abdominal pain.
Weight loss.","No single test can identify AOSD. Because of this, tests might be done that exclude other diseases, especially infection and cancer. Doctors diagnose it after reviewing a person's medical history and symptoms, which include arthritis lasting at least 6 weeks.","In the disease’s early stages, doctors can prescribe nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications, like ibuprofen and naproxen, and steroid hormones to reduce inflammation, pain and fever, and prevent long-term damage to joints. If steroids are used, other drugs are given to guard against possible negative side effects from steroids, such as opportunistic infection, stomach ulcers and weak bones."
"Stroke","One-sided weakness or paralysis.
Aphasia (difficulty with or loss of speaking ability).
Slurred or garbled speaking (dysarthria).

Lab blood tests (looking for signs of infections or heart damage, checking clotting ability and blood sugar levels, testing how well kidneys and liver function, etc.).
Electrocardiogram (abbreviated ECG or EKG) to make sure that a heart issue isn’t the source of the problem.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans.
Electroencephalogram (EEG), though less common, can rule out seizures or related problems.","Ischemic: With ischemic strokes, the top priority is restoring circulation to affected brain areas. If this happens fast enough, it’s sometimes possible to prevent permanent damage or at least limit a stroke’s severity. Restoring circulation usually involves a certain medication type called thrombolytics, but may also involve a catheterization procedure.
Hemorrhagic: With hemorrhagic strokes, treatment depends on the location and severity of the bleeding. Reducing blood pressure is often the top priority because this will reduce the amount of bleeding and keep it from getting worse. Another treatment option is to improve clotting so the bleeding will stop. Surgery is sometimes necessary to relieve pressure on your brain from accumulated blood."
"Hemorrhagic Stroke","Headaches (experts often call these “thunderclap” headaches because they’re sudden and severe, like an unexpected clap of thunder).
Light sensitivity, where bright lights cause severe headache-like pain (photophobia).

Use of proton pump inhibitors (PPI) for acid reflux, gastritis, indigestion, or peptic ulcer disease.
Vagotomy, surgery to remove part of your vagus nerve. This long nerve runs from your brainstem to your abdomen. It carries signals to your heart and digestive system.","To diagnose hypergastrinemia, healthcare providers need to find out how much gastric acid you’re producing. They will use tests to measure your gastrin levels:","Colorectal cancer, gastric outlet obstruction, kidney disease, MEN-1 and ZE syndrome: Surgery that treats these conditions will also treat hypergastrinemia symptoms.
ACG and H. pylori infection: Antibiotics can help to treat these conditions.
Proton-pump inhibitors: Stopping PPI usually reverses hypergastrinemia in five to seven days.
Retained antrum syndrome: Getting rid of the remaining lower stomach (antral) tissue can lower excess stomach acid."
"Enlarged Spleen","Upper left abdominal pain. It may also radiate to your left shoulder or back.
Palpable spleen. You usually can’t feel your spleen with your hand, unless it’s enlarged.
Loss of appetite or early fullness. Your enlarged spleen might encroach on your stomach below.","Imaging tests.

An MRI can trace the blood flow through your spleen.
Blood tests. If your healthcare provider is unsure of the cause, they may investigate with blood tests. They can test for specific diseases, cancers, blood disorders and liver function problems.
Bone marrow analysis. Your provider might take a bone marrow aspiration and/or bone marrow biopsy to test the blood cell content in your bone marrow tissues. This can give them information about how your spleen is functioning and can indicate certain disorders.","In many cases, the spleen will return to normal size as the underlying condition improves. Some conditions, such as transient infections, may go away by themselves. Your provider may treat other conditions with medication, blood treatments or surgery. Some have no cure. In these cases, healthcare providers may treat your enlarged spleen with low-dose radiation therapy to reduce it, or surgery to remove it."
"Nephrotic Syndrome","Large amounts (greater than 3.5 grams) of the protein albumin in your pee (albuminuria).

Nausea and vomiting (bloody vomit).
Indigestion (dyspepsia).
Burping.
Loss of appetite.
Dark stools (from blood in your stool).","A breath test: In this test, you exhale into a bag before and after drinking a solution. The test measures the amount of carbon dioxide released in your breath before and after drinking the solution. A higher level after drinking the solution means H. pylori are present.
A stool test: This test looks for evidence of H. pylori in a stool sample.
Upper endoscopy: A flexible tube is inserted down the throat into the stomach. A small tissue sample from the stomach or intestine lining is taken for testing for the presence of H. pylori.","Antibiotics: Usually two antibiotics are prescribed.

Hernias.","Prenatal screening tests, like amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling, can diagnose your child with Hurler syndrome while you’re pregnant. Both tests examine whether or not there are any genetic abnormalities within your baby’s DNA.","Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT): Replacing damaged enzymes can prevent symptoms from getting worse and has the potential to reverse complications. Your child's healthcare provider will schedule regular shots of alpha L-iduronidase (aldurazyme) early after a diagnosis. The frequency of the shots depend on the severity of your child's diagnosis and is a lifelong treatment option.
Hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT): For children under two years old (and some over two years old, by the supervision of their provider) diagnosed with Hurler’s syndrome, HSCT can prolong life expectancy in severe cases, prevent disease progression, preserve cognitive function and reduce symptoms that affect their body (somatic). Stem cells from donors with functioning enzymes that are found in bone marrow (hematopoietic cells) replace damaged cells in a child via chemotherapy."
"Treacher Collins Syndrome","Their airways might be partially blocked, making it hard to breathe.
Their eyelids have a noticeable downward slant sometimes called “sad eyes.” It may look as if they’ve been crying.
They have a cleft palate, a condition where infants are born with an opening in the roof of their mouths. Cleft palates can make it difficult for babies to nurse or drink from bottles.
Their cheekbones appear flattened and are smaller than typical newborns.
Their lower jaws are smaller than most newborns.
Their ears might be smaller than most newborns or be shaped differently.
They might have hearing loss detected during routine newborn hearing tests. An additional examination might reveal problems with the three small bones that are your child’s middle ear. These bones transmit sound.","Healthcare providers might make a preliminary diagnosis based on regular newborn examinations. If your child’s symptoms indicate Treacher Collins syndrome, your healthcare provider might refer you to a genetics specialist to confirm the preliminary diagnosis.","Nose: Extra tissue or bone is blocking the back of your child’s nose, making it hard for them to breathe through their nose. Treatment includes surgery to remove the extra bone or tissue
Lower jaw: Your child’s lower jaw is set at a steep angle. This is called micrognathia. About half of children with this condition have sleep apnea. It can also affect your child’s ability to eat. If your child’s breathing issues are mild, changing sleep positions can help, such as having your child sleep on their side. Your child’s healthcare provider might recommend your child use a temporary tube, called a nose trumpet or a continuous positive airway pressure device (CPAP). More severe breathing problems might require surgery such as endotracheal tubes or tracheotomy. Your child’s healthcare provider may also recommend jaw-lengthening surgery.
Cleft palate: Surgery to close the gap in the roof of your child’s mouth.
Facial differences: These surgeries are called craniofacial reconstructions. They’re usually done during your child’s teenage years and as needed to help your child’s breathing and other physical symptoms. Not every child wants or needs facial reconstruction.
Eyes: The syndrome can affect the tissue and bones around your child’s eyes so your child’s eyes slant down. It can also create a notch in your child’s lower eyelid. Treatment may include surgery to fix the notch in your child’s lower eyelid.
Cheekbones: The syndrome can cause your child’s cheekbones to be smaller than usual, or to be missing. Treatment for this may include bone grafts or synthetic implants to rebuild cheekbones.
Jaws: Your child’s lower jaw and/or upper jaw might be set back at a steep angle, which affects their ability to eat and breathe. Treatment for this may include corrective surgery to fix your child’s upper and lower jaws to correct their bite and help with breathing and chewing.
External ears: Your child’s external ear might be missing, be smaller than normal or be oddly shaped. Treatment for this may include surgeries to rebuild or build your child’s external ears using tissue and bone grafts or artificial materials.
Hearing: The syndrome can affect hearing in two ways. Your child might not develop ear canals, having an eardrum or the small bones that make up their middle ear. Or your child might have hearing structures that are oddly shaped, which means sound can’t get through them. Treatment for hearing-related issues may include surgery to build the missing hearing structures, bone-anchored implants to support hearing, speech therapy and educational support."

Illness anxiety disorder (hypochondriasis).
Obsessive-compulsive disorder.
Panic disorder.
Paranoid personality disorder.","Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT): CBT focuses on helping you change the way you think about ferns. Your therapist may provide facts about ferns, such as which types are poisonous and where they’re found. You also learn to identify what triggers your anxiety. For example, perhaps you’re only scared of indoor ferns or ferns that are near water.
Exposure therapy: CBT and exposure therapy often go hand in hand. You gradually expose yourself to fear triggers so you can learn how to manage your anxiety. You may look at pictures of ferns or take a walk through a park that contains ferns. Your therapist can give you strategies for keeping panic at bay, such as deep breathing or meditation.
Medication: Your healthcare provider may recommend anti-anxiety drugs, sedatives or beta-blockers if you have frequent panic attacks about ferns. Medication doesn’t treat the source of your fear, but it may help."
"Trimethylaminuria (TMAU, Fish Odor Syndrome)","Avoiding people because they’re embarrassed about their condition. Being socially isolated can lead to depression, frustration and loneliness.

Reduced quality of life: Persistent difficulties going to the bathroom are hard to live with. They can cause physical and emotional stress and prevent you from enjoying a healthy social life.
Pouch stricture: Chronic inflammation can lead to scarring in your pouch. Scarring can cause the opening to narrow. It can also reduce blood flow to your pouch, which interferes with healing.
Erosion: Prolonged inflammation can cause erosion of the lining in your pouch, leading to ulcers, which may bleed. Some pathogenic bacteria may also actively erode your gut barrier.
Malabsorption and malnutrition: Damage to the lining in your pouch can interfere with its ability to absorb nutrients from the food inside (malabsorption), leading to malnutrition.
Pouch failure: Persistent difficulties with your pouch ultimately may make it unusable. You may have to have another operation to remove the pouch and redirect your bowel to an ileostomy.","Contrast pouchography (pouchogram). This is a type of X-ray that involves injecting a contrast solution into your pouch to make it stand out. It’s the ileal pouch version of a barium enema.
CT scan.

Corticosteroids: Corticosteroids are anti-inflammatory drugs to treat chronic inflammation.
Immunosuppressants: These drugs turn down the volume on your immune system response. Healthcare providers prescribe them when your immune system causes chronic inflammation.
Monoclonal antibodies (biologics): Monoclonal antibodies are human-made proteins that act like human antibodies, boosting your natural immune response to infections.
Small molecules: These are newer medications that work similarly to monoclonal antibodies but are synthetic.
Fecal microbiota transplant: Fecal transplant is U.S. Food and Drug (FDA)-approved to help treat antibiotic-resistant C. diff infection.

Unexplained weight loss.","Imaging: Your provider may perform a computed tomography (CT) scan to see where the tumors are located. They may conduct a CT/Pet scan or F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET for more detailed views of the inside of your body. A CT/Pet scan allows your provider to perform two imaging procedures (a CT scan and a PET scan) at the same time. Fluorodeoxyglucose is a chemical inserted into your body during a PET scan. It clusters around cancer cells, so they show up more clearly during imaging.
Histopathology: Your provider will remove a tumor sample during a biopsy and study the tissue closely beneath a microscope. This type of analysis is called histopathology. Your provider can determine if a tumor is sarcomatoid carcinoma based on how its cells look. They’ll also classify it into subtypes (for example, pleomorphic carcinoma, spindle-cell carcinoma, etc.)
Immunohistochemistry: Immunohistochemistry tests for substances, called antigens, associated with specific cell types. Certain types of antigens can signal that a cell is abnormal or malignant (cancerous).","The most effective treatment is surgery to remove the entire tumor. Chemotherapy following surgery can help destroy remaining cancer cells. Usually, though, surgery isn’t an option because the cancer’s already spread by the time people receive a diagnosis. You may receive radiation therapy if a tumor causes problems like pain, bleeding or trouble breathing."

Sleep-related laryngospasm. Some people experience laryngospasm in their sleep and wake up gasping for air. Often, this is related to vocal cord dysfunction or acid reflux.
Anesthesia. In some cases, laryngospasm occurs during general anesthesia. This happens when the anesthesia or extubation (removal of the nose or throat tube) irritates your vocal cords. This type of laryngospasm is more common in certain individuals, including children, people undergoing surgery on their larynx or pharynx and those with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
Laryngeal hypersensitivity (irritable larynx syndrome). If the mucosa of your upper airway is too sensitive, anything that stimulates it may cause a laryngospasm, such as cold air, talking loud, coughing or eating certain foods.","Laryngospasm can happen suddenly and without warning, lasting up to one minute. Symptoms can be mild or severe. For example, you might be able to exhale and cough, but have difficulty breathing in. If you think you’ve experienced laryngospasm, talk to your healthcare provider.","Try not to panic or gasp for air. Remaining calm can help you relax more through the laryngospasm.
Take small sips of water. This will help wash away any irritants that may have come in contact with your vocal cords.

The light activates the medication and kills cancer cells.
Extracorporeal photophoresis (ECP): This treatment involves ultraviolet light and psoralen. Providers take some of your blood so they can obtain white blood cells. They mix those cells with psoralen. This makes cancerous cells vulnerable to ultraviolet (UV) light. These cells are then exposed to UV light, killing the cancer cells. They then return the treated white blood cells to your bloodstream.
Radiation therapy: Providers target cancer cells with X-rays or other radiation sources, slowing cancer cell growth or killing the cells.
Immunotherapy: This treatment boosts your immune system with lab-made substances or your body’s substances. Immunotherapy helps slow cancer cell growth or eliminate cancer cells.
Chemotherapy: You may take chemotherapy as pills, via intravenous injection (IV) or as gels, creams or lotions that are directly applied to your skin’s affected areas."

Sometimes, your doctor may take a sample of the skin growth (biopsy) to test for HPV.","At-home wart removal: Over-the-counter (OTC) wart removal medications, such as Compound W®, contain salicylic acid. This chemical dissolves warts one layer at a time. These products come in liquid, gel and patch form. You may need to apply the medication every day for several months to get rid of the wart completely.
Freezing: During a procedure called cryotherapy, your doctor applies liquid nitrogen to freeze the wart. After freezing, a blister forms. Eventually, the blister and wart peel off. You may need several treatments.
Immunotherapy: For stubborn warts that don’t respond to traditional treatments, immunotherapy helps your immune system fight the virus. This process involves a topical chemical, such as diphencyprone (DCP). DCP causes a mild allergic reaction that makes the wart go away.
Laser treatment: Your doctor uses laser light to heat and destroy tiny blood vessels inside the wart. The process cuts off blood supply, killing the wart.
