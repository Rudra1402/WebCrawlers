Disease Name,Symptoms,Diagnosis,Treatments
"B-cell Lymphoma","Fever.; Drenching night sweats.; Unintentional loss of more than 10% of body weight over 6 months.; Painless swelling in one or more lymph node(s).; Persistent fatigue.; Loss of appetite.; Cough or chest pain.; Stomach pain.; A sensation of bloating or fullness caused by an enlarged spleen.; Itchy skin.; Enlargement of the spleen or liver.; Rashes or skin lumps.","Complete blood count (CBC). A CBC measures and counts your blood cells. Providers use CBC to detect a variety of illnesses.; Blood chemistry test. This test measures the number of certain substances in your blood.; Computed tomography (CT) scan. CT scans use a series of X-rays and a computer to create three-dimensional images of your soft tissues and bones.; Positron emissions tomography (PET) scan. Providers inject a radioactive tracer into your body to detect early signs of cancer.; Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This is a painless test that uses a large magnet, radio waves and a computer to produce very clear images of organs and structures within your body.; Lumbar puncture (spinal tap). To do this test, your healthcare provider inserts a needle into your lower back to get a sample of cerebrospinal fluid, the clear liquid that surrounds your spine and brain.; Bone marrow biopsy. To do this test, providers insert a special needle through your skin and into your pelvic bone or breastbone so they can remove a small sample of bone marrow from inside it.","Chemotherapy. Healthcare providers use several types of drugs to kill cancer cells.; Radiation therapy. Healthcare providers use strong beams of energy (radiation) to kill cancer cells or stop them from growing.; Targeted therapy. This treatment involves medications that target specific changes in cancer cells.; Immunotherapy. This cancer treatment uses your immune system to fight cancer by helping your body produce cancer-fighting cells or help healthy cells identify and attack cancer cells.; Stem cell transplantation. A stem cell transplant replaces unhealthy stem cells with healthy stem cells."
"Hepatitis B","Not everyone has symptoms. If you do, they can range from mild to severe. You may have symptoms (or not) during the acute phase of infection, and you may also have them (or not) with chronic infection. You’re still contagious with or without symptoms.","If you have an acute or chronic infection.; If you’ve been infected in the past.; If you’ve developed immunity to the virus.; If the infection is interfering with your liver function.","Vaccination. Healthcare providers recommend an immediate dose of the hepatitis B vaccine if you haven’t had it yet, preferably within 24 hours of exposure. You’ll need two more doses over the next six months to become fully vaccinated against the virus.; Hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG). HBIG is a substance made from human blood containing naturally-produced antibodies to the hepatitis B virus. It’s given as a shot to help prevent infection in people who’ve recently been exposed to the virus."
"Hemophilia B","Hemophilia B is a genetic bleeding disorder. If you have hemophilia B, it means you inherited an abnormal gene that affects the amount of clotting factor 9 in your body. Normally, a gene called F9 carries instructions on how to create factor 9. Hemophilia B happens when that gene mutates and becomes an abnormal gene that leads to low factor 9 levels or even missing factor 9. Men or people DMAB inherit hemophilia B if their biological mothers carry the condition.","Complete blood count (CBT): Providers use this test to measure and study blood cells.; Prothrombin time (PT) test: Providers use this test to see how quickly your blood clots.; Activated partial thromboplastin time test: This is another blood test to see how long it takes your blood to form a clot.; Fibrinogen test: This is a blood test to measure the amount of blood protein fibrinogen, which helps with clotting.; Clotting factor test: This blood test shows the hemophilia type and severity.","Healthcare providers typically treat hemophilia B with factor replacement therapy. In factor replacement therapy, providers inject concentrated factor 9 into people’s bloodstreams. The concentrated factor 9 takes the place of the missing factor and helps prevent excessive bleeding or control bleeding when it happens."
"Cutaneous B-Cell Lymphoma","Fever.; Night sweats.; Swollen lymph nodes in your neck, armpits or groin.; Weight loss.","Blood tests.; Imaging tests such as CT scan or PET scan.; Bone marrow biopsy.; Biopsy of the lymph nodes.","Active surveillance, or “watch and wait,” which involves monitoring the condition until treatment is necessary.; Chemotherapy.; Medications rubbed on your skin (topical) or injected, such as corticosteroids.; Monoclonal antibodies such as rituximab.; Radiation therapy.; Surgical removal."
"Group B Strep Pregnancy","Fever, chills and fatigue.; Difficulty breathing.; Chest pains.; Muscle stiffness.","Yes, your healthcare provider will test you for GBS late in your pregnancy, around weeks 36 to 37.","Healthcare providers prevent GBS infection in your baby by treating you with intravenous (IV) antibiotics during labor and delivery. The most common antibiotic to treat group B strep is penicillin or ampicillin. Giving you an antibiotic at this time helps prevent the spread of GBS from you to your newborn. It's not effective to treat GBS earlier than at delivery. The antibiotics work best when given at least four hours before delivery. About 90% of infections are prevented with this type of treatment."

"Group A Streptococcal Infections","Difficulty swallowing or pain when swallowing.; Headache.; Small red spots on the roof of your moth (petechiae).; Sore throat.; Stomach pain.; Swollen tonsils or lymph nodes.","A blood test to look for an infection.; A rapid test or culture test that swabs your throat and looks for bacteria under a microscope.; A tissue sample to look for an infection in a biopsy.; An imaging test like an MRI, CT scan or ultrasound to look at the damage underneath your skin caused by the infection.","Shortening the length of your illness.; Minimizing symptoms.; Preventing the bacteria from spreading.; Preventing complications and serious illness."
"Hemophilia A","The F8 gene sits on the X chromosome.; Women and people AFAB inherit two X chromosomes, one each from their mother and father.; Men and people AMAB inherit an X chromosome from their mother and a Y chromosome from their father.; If a woman or someone AFAB has an abnormal F8 gene on one of their X chromosomes, they carry hemophilia, but they won’t have symptoms. That’s because there’s a normal F8 gene on their second X chromosome.; They can pass the chromosome carrying the abnormal F8 gene on to their sons. Because men and people AMAB have just one X chromosome, their sons will develop hemophilia. Men and people AMAB can’t pass hemophilia on to their sons, though.; If a woman or someone AFAB has a daughter, they may also pass this chromosome on to that child. Because women and people AFAB have two X chromosomes, their baby is likely to inherit a healthy X chromosome from their father.; Women and people AFAB who inherit a healthy chromosome and a chromosome carrying the mutated F8 gene can pass the gene on to their children. These people are sometimes referred to as carriers.","Complete blood count: Healthcare providers use this test to measure and study blood cells.; Prothrombin time (PT) test: Healthcare providers use this test to see how quickly your blood clots.; Activated partial thromboplastin time test:This is another blood test to time blood clot formation.; Fibrinogen test:This is a blood test to measure the amount of blood protein fibrinogen, which helps with clotting.; Clotting factor test:This blood test shows the hemophilia type and severity.","Healthcare providers typically treat hemophilia A with factor replacement therapy. If you’re receiving this treatment, your healthcare providers will inject concentrated factor VIII into your bloodstream. Factor VIII replaces the missing blood protein, or factor, that helps blood to clot, so you’re less likely to have excessive bleeding and/or be able to control bleeding when it happens. Usually, people with mild or moderate hemophilia A don’t need replacement therapy unless they’re going to have surgery or if they’re dealing with a bleeding episode. Healthcare providers often treat people who have severe hemophilia A with regular factor replacement therapy. Another treatment option is a drug called emicizumab, which is a monoclonal antibody that substitutes the normal function of factor VIII."
"Vitamin A Deficiency","Chronic diarrhea.; Celiac disease.; Cystic fibrosis.; Certain pancreatic disorders.; Bile duct blockage.; Zinc or iron deficiency.; Small bowel bypass or bariatric surgery.; Alcohol use disorder.; Intestine or pancreas surgery.","Your healthcare provider can diagnose vitamin A deficiency based on your symptoms and a blood test.","Your healthcare provider will treat your vitamin A deficiency with high doses of a vitamin A supplement for several days. After several days, they’ll have you take lower doses of vitamin A until your vision and skin issues start to resolve. Vitamin A supplements can cure night blindness and help lubricate your eyes again. However, vision loss due to scarring from corneal ulcers can’t be cured."
"Hepatitis A","Stomach pain, especially in the upper right quadrant.; Loss of appetite.; Nausea and vomiting.; Diarrhea.; Weakness and fatigue.; Fever.; Jaundice (yellowing of your skin and eyes).; Joint pain.; Itchy skin.; Light-colored poop and dark-colored pee.","Jaundice.; Enlarged liver.; Enlarged spleen.","Stay hydrated. Broths are great for both hydration and nutrition, especially when you’re feeling nauseated. Smoothies are another way to add healthy calories with hydration.; Stay in bed, at least until your fever and jaundice have subsided. After that, you may return to work or school if it’s been at least one week since your symptoms started.; Avoid substances that stress your liver. Take a break from alcohol, smoking, drugs and medications if possible. Check with your healthcare provider before taking herbs.; Keep in touch. They’ll want to check on you periodically to make sure your condition is improving. If you have severe symptoms, they might want to monitor you more closely."
"Saddle Nose","Nasal pain or discomfort.; Nosebleeds (epistaxis).; Chronic crusting around your nose.; Turned-up nasal tip.; Breathing issues.; Horizontal crease on the lower portion of your nose.; Nasal septum perforation (when there’s a hole in the cartilage that separates your nostrils).","Minimal saddle nose: There’s a small depression in your dorsum (the bridge of your nose).; Moderate saddle nose: There’s a larger depression in your dorsum and your nose looks flattened from all angles. The tip of your nose may turn upward.; Major saddle nose: There’s an obvious lack of bony support and cartilage, causing your dorsum to sink in. The tip of your nose turns upward.","Surgery is the most common treatment for saddle nose deformity. However, some mild cases may respond to dermal filler injections."
"B-cell Lymphoma","Fever.; Drenching night sweats.; Unintentional loss of more than 10% of body weight over 6 months.; Painless swelling in one or more lymph node(s).; Persistent fatigue.; Loss of appetite.; Cough or chest pain.; Stomach pain.; A sensation of bloating or fullness caused by an enlarged spleen.; Itchy skin.; Enlargement of the spleen or liver.; Rashes or skin lumps.","Complete blood count (CBC).

That’s because there’s a normal F9 gene on their second X chromosome.; This person can pass the chromosome carrying the abnormal F9 gene on to their biological male child. As men and people DMAB have just the one chromosome, they’ll develop hemophilia B.","Complete blood count (CBT): Providers use this test to measure and study blood cells.; Prothrombin time (PT) test: Providers use this test to see how quickly your blood clots.; Activated partial thromboplastin time test: This is another blood test to see how long it takes your blood to form a clot.; Fibrinogen test: This is a blood test to measure the amount of blood protein fibrinogen, which helps with clotting.; Clotting factor test: This blood test shows the hemophilia type and severity.","Healthcare providers typically treat hemophilia B with factor replacement therapy.

"Hemophilia C","Nosebleeds.; Bruising easily.; Blood in pee.; Excessive bleeding after circumcision.; Painful, swollen bruises after surgery.; Unusually heavy or long-lasting periods.","Activated partial thromboplastin time test: This hemophilia screening test tells your healthcare provider how long it takes your blood to clot.; Clotting factor test: This blood test shows the hemophilia type and severity.","People with hemophilia C may not need treatment unless they’re going to have surgery or other procedures. When they do, healthcare providers use a combination of fresh frozen plasma from donated blood and medication that keeps replacement clotting factors from breaking down. They may prescribe birth control pills for women who have unusually heavy or long-lasting periods."
"Protein C Deficiency","Blood clots in your veins (also called venous thromboembolism). Blood clots usually form in your legs (deep vein thrombosis) but can also form in the veins of the large and small intestines, your brain, the main vein to your liver and in other areas.

Blood clots are more likely to develop with increasing age.","Personal history of having blood clots.; Family history of having blood clots.; Blood tests that determine the level of protein C activity and the level of protein C itself.; Genetic testing to detect mutation in PROC gene (but not needed to confirm diagnosis).","No treatment: Most people don’t need treatment except during surgery or if they are pregnant, have experienced trauma (such as a car accident) or are physically inactive.; Treatment with an anticoagulant: If you have had a blood-clotting (thrombotic) event."
"Hepatitis C","Exposure to needles or sharp objects at work, especially in healthcare.; Tattoos or body piercings performed with unsterilized equipment.; Sharing a razor or toothbrush with somebody who might have bled using it.; Less commonly, through sexual contact that leads to blood exposure.","Liver function tests. Liver function tests are a series of blood tests that evaluate the health of your liver.; Elastography. An elastography is a noninvasive imaging test that measures the stiffness or fibrosis of your liver tissue. It uses ultrasound or MRI.; Liver biopsy.
